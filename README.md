# Chess AI
A project to build valid chess gameplay with visualizer followed by various chess engines - one based only off what I have in my head, one based on research, and maybe an AI one or some fun ones too. Considering extending this to online gameplay too just to see what that looks like.

It's called Chess AI because this was originally created as a way to see what "vibe coding" was all about. Most of the base game was vibe coded, but some refactorings for fun + engines mostly done by hand.
